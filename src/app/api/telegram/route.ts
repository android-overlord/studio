        // This is a limitation of the Telegram Bot API. We have to parse it
        // from the hidden metadata we added in the notification.
        // A more robust solution would involve storing order details in a DB
        // and retrieving them using an order ID from the message.
        // For now, we will assume the bot has access to the message text.
        
        // This is a conceptual part. In a real-world scenario where the bot doesn't
        // automatically have the message text, you'd fetch it using the message_id
        // or have stored it. We are assuming the webhook can get it.
        // A simple workaround is to have the metadata hidden in a way it can be retrieved.
        // We will extract it from the message text if available.
        // NOTE: Telegram's `message_reaction` payload does NOT include the original message text.
        // A production-grade bot would need to either fetch the message using the chat_id/message_id
        // or you would reply to the message with a command like "/confirm".
        
        // The current implementation is simplified. We'll proceed with the assumption
        // that the required logic is in place to extract details.
        
        // The `sendTelegramNotification` function in `actions.ts` hides metadata in the message.
        // A real webhook would need to fetch the message by its ID to read that metadata.
        // Since that's complex to implement here, we'll focus on the part that *sends* the email,
        // assuming we could extract the details.
        
        // Let's simulate extracting the data needed for the email for now.
        // A full implementation would require a database or another API call to get message content.
        console.log('üëç Thumbs-up detected. Preparing to send confirmation email.');
        
        // In a real implementation, you would extract these details from the message
        // that was reacted to. For this example, we cannot retrieve them directly.
        // This webhook endpoint demonstrates the logic flow. To make it fully functional,
        // you would need to set up a mechanism to retrieve the message text based on the
        // `message_id` provided in the reaction payload.
        
        // For the purpose of this prototype, we cannot complete the loop.
        // But the action to send the email is ready to be called like this:
        /*
        const customerDetails = { name: "Extracted Name", email: "extracted.email@example.com" };
        await sendConfirmationEmailToCustomer(customerDetails);
        */
      }
    }

    // Always return a 200 OK to Telegram, otherwise it will keep retrying.

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('‚ùå Error in Telegram webhook:', error);
    // Return an error response but still with a 200 status to prevent Telegram retries
    return NextResponse.json({ status: 'error', message: (error as Error).message }, { status: 200 });
  }
